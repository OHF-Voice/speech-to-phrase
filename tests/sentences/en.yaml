# Values used to format sentence templates and slot values below.
# These are separate from lists, but there is likely a lot of overlap.
#
# When you add a test value list named "timer_set", for example, then:
# 1. You must list "timer_set" in "uses_format_values" for the test sentence
#    block.
# 2. Any {timer_set} in the sentence templates or slot values will be replaced
#    by each value in turn, as if you had written out the individual tests.
